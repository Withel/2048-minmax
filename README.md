# 2048-minmax heuristics
 
<br> 

Very fun project that introduced me to the world of heuristics. 

In the notebook there is game of 2048 (https://play2048.co), which plays itself with help of the heuristics, and being more specific min-max algorithm. 

Unfortunatelly, these heuristics are pretty poorly defined so it's no guaranteed that game will finish with the win (2048 in single square).
